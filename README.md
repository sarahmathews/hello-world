Hi, it's Sarah! I'm new to coding and have recently completed Codeacademy's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses. I'm also currently taking a C# class. I would love to learn to code and create my own projects. I am a Quality Assurance Analyst at a interactive design agency and I believe learning to code will further my understanding of QA as well.

Outside of work I enjoy, eating great food, drinking delicous beers, knitting, crocheting, dancing, music, hiking, camping, and adventuring. I have a cat named Zorro, he's the best!
